# Research paper template

This repository contains a template for writing a research paper. The template
is in the IEEE document style of the [LaTeX](https://www.tug.org/texlive/)
typesetting system. I recommend you have a look at my other repository
containing a
[research proposal template](https://github.com/ianmcloughlin/research-proposal)
if you are unfamiliar with LaTeX.

# Using the template
1. I recommend you use TeX Live/MacTeX with Visual Studio Code. If you don't
   have these then I recommend having a look at the
   [research proposal template](https://github.com/ianmcloughlin/research-proposal)
   repository as above.
2. With those installed, you can fork this repository by clicking the Fork
   button at the top right to get your own personal copy of the repository.
3. Then clone your repository by clicking the green "Clone or download" button
   on the GitHub page for your copy of the repository. Make sure to copy the
   `https` URL rather than the `git@github` URL. Then go to cmder or
   the Terminal and type `git clone <URL>` replacing `<URL>` with your URL.
3. Use `cd research-paper` to move into the project folder and then type
   `code .`. If VSCode doesn't automatically open you might have to manually
   open it and open the folder using the File menu.
